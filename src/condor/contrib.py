    for anything. Used directly by subclasses (e.g., user code may use
    `u=DynamicsModel.t`, implementations will use this symbol
    directly for fields)

    parameter - auxilary variables (constant-in-time) that determine system behavior

    state - fully defines evolution of system driven by ODEs

    dot - derivative of state with respect to indepdnent variable, purely a function of
    state, independent_variable, parameters
    [DAE version will have a residual associated with state differential]

    output - dynamic output at particular state and value of independent variable
    (point-wise in independent variable)

    control - time-varying placeholder, useful for re-defining using mode, etc.
    set it with `make` field -- all controls MUST be set? or default to 0.

    make - set control a value/computation. Or `let`?

    note: no time-varying input to system. Assume dynamicsmodels "pull" what they need
    from other models.
    Need to augment state with "pulled" dynamicsmodels
    But do need a "control" that could be defined based on mode? automatically added to
    output? or is it always just a placeholder for functional space gradient?
    Or also allow it to define eg feedback control

    I guess block diagram is nice for simulating something like saturation block --
    create event and switch modes? but I guess that's re-creatable with modes. But maybe
    needs control/subsitution -- I guess what I'm calling "control" is really an
    (explicit) algebraic state? I guess this is really the same as an "output" and is in
    fact how simupy implements it. maybe convert output to a freefield that takes an
    expression (like constraint, I guess?) and then "make" is only in mode and adds
    conditional behavior -- defaults to value from creation?

    then keep control field but only for open loop control? not sure, but some way to
    mark an output as a control signal

    don't include specialty types like discrete control, etc? user must know that for
    discrete time signal it requires state with dot=0 and update

    dt - reserved keyword for DT?

    inner model "Event" (see below). For a MyODESyStem model, create a sub-class of
    MyODESystem.Event,
    inner classes of "Mode" subclass -- conditional overwrite of dot and make
    inner classes of TrajectoryAnalysis -- perform simulations with particular

    Event implementation is owned by TA implementation, maybe in sub-name space to avoid
    extraneous implementation constructions.
    then when trajectory analysis is evaluated and bound, add events... somewhere. Maybe
    the _res.e elements get replaced by the evaluated Event models (so one for each
    occurance of the event)??? function isn't necessary, so maybe get an index instead.

        degrees : float or array-like, optional
            Degree of interpolant for each axis (or broadcastable). Default is 3.

            for left | 1 for right, :] = (order, value)`` for specifying derivative
